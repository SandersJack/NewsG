- Change signal to pulse conversion in EventAction

- Set random seeds manually:
  - Internal Geant4 (DONE)
  - PrimaryGeneratorAction (TRandom3 For initial particle positions)
  - UserG4FastSimulationModel (TRandom3 for various things)
  - ElectronAvalanche (gRandom for Polya distribution)

- Write a program to plot Magboltz gas properties for given E-field ranges and pressures

- Move magboltz code over to simulationg4 instead of the separate repository

- Investigate electrons leaving drift medium status message

- Investigate local position vs global position for Garfield Hits
  - Global position does work, but local should be the same co-ordinates as global (it used to be)

- Update physics lists from Gamma camera

- For AvalCustom, Initial ion and electron drift position is actually the position where the electron hits the anode, not the avalanche starting position

- Fix visualisation (issue with Qt not finding a plugin)

- Make a program that can do the Signal Calculation standalone instead of rerunning the whole simulation
  - Already began this

- Make a program that can do the Garfield avalanching standalone instead of rerunning the whole simulation
  - Update the original Garfield simulation and use the ``Ionisation'' class to load in initial positions of the electrons when given to UserG4FSM

- Add macro command to switch detector size between 15cm and 30cm throughout the simulation

- Add macro command to change gas in geant4

- Investigate differences in ANSYS .lis file versions to make them compatible with Garfield's ComponentAnsys121

- Make commands to toggle ideal E-field and its parameters in the macro instead of hardcoded

- Use formula to calculate Fano factor from W-value instead of it being set to 0.19 by default

- Track energy of primary electrons given to Garfield?

- Fix anode radius being hardcoded for AvalancheMicroscopic status messages in ElectronAvalanche.cc

- Check if any of the electrons are still drifting backwards

- Investigate average diffusion of the electrons starting in different positions

- Check if cathode thickness is correct

[- Adapt ideal vs ANSYS E-field plotting to be a separate code?]

[- Tidy up code by removing legacy commented out gamma camera code?] 

[- Set up a doxygen?]

[- Continue profiling the simulation to see where we can save time?]
