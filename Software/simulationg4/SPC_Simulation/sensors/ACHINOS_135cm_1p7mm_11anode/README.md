Main differences from basicAchinos:
no gap between the rod and central electrode; increased size of central electrode, to be closer to real sensor; Detector size is 135 cm diameter; improved mesh around the anodes; anode diam 1.7 mm; anode locations different.

The various PRNSOL correspond to:
  *PRNSOL.lis - Full voltage solution
  *PRNSOL_E.lis - Full electric field solution, for reference
  *PRNSOL_north.lis - The north (6 ball side. Away from rod) weighting field
  *PRNSOL_south.lis - The south (5 ball side. rod-side) weighting field
  *PRNSOL_s*V.lis - Full voltage solutions corresponding to the SNOGLOBE measurements tj13*. These were tests for the fiducial volume by varying the voltage on the south. the value (as a wild card in the title of this point) is the voltage applied to the south anodes.
