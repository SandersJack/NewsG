The NEWS-G collaboration's goal is to use Spherical Proportional Counters (SPC) to directly detect Dark Matter

# Project
A large background for low-intensity searches is from neutrons produced from fission products found in the Earth's surface. These need to be understood/negated using the same SPCs.  
The project was to detect neutrons using an SPC filled with Nitrogen high pressures
